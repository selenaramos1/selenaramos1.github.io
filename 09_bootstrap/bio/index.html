            who's embarking on an exciting journey into the world of web
            development. With a strong foundation in healthcare, I've developed

            basic web development. I recently aqcuired some experience with
            Adobe Creative Cloud applications such as Adobe Illustrator and

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            I'm an adventurous individual who finds immense joy in outdoor
            activities and physical challenges. Skateboarding, rock climbing,
            and hiking are my passions, and they define much of my free time.
            They offer both mental and physical challenges. These activities not
            only keep me active and healthy but also foster a deep connection
            with nature and a sense of accomplishment that I cherish.
