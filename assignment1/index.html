   <p>My favorite beverage, aside from water, is a Matcha Green Tea Latte (specifically from Peet's Coffee). The one from Starbucks is made with a sugar and matcha blend, while the one from Peet's is made from ceremonial grade matcha and has no added sweetner unless requested. Matcha itself contains caffeine, although less than coffee at 70 mg per serving compared to the 150mg in coffee. Matcha also has many benefits for health along with a good lasting energy boost.</p>
